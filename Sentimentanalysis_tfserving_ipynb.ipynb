I wanted something she could take with her and also a way to better control how she reported information. This was the perfect solution! Now I'm getting all the information I wanted. There is a very helpful example of how to fill it out. It also has a pouch for additional documents and a section up front for emergency contact info. Each page goes from 7 - 6. This works for me because the nanny starts at 7am and ends before 6pm. I use an app on my phone for tracking when I'm with the baby. I transfer the info from this notebook to my phone. My only complaint: the space is pretty small - they provide useful shorthand, but it's a little difficult to fit some of the info in the space provided. Also, some of the other reviews complain about the 7 - 6 time format. This isn't a real problem for me, but I suppose if you wanted to track an entire day, you would have to use two pages - not too big of a deal. 7am - 6pm is pretty much perfect for daycare/nanny/caregiver situation.\",\n",

He can sit there for ten minutes just flipping the sunroof back and forth!  Go figure!  These cars are super sturdy and have taken quite a beating on our coffee table.  (They're in much better shape than the coffee table at this point.)  I love that they nest together so they don't take up too much space when they're put away.

Each car has a neat fun feature for little ones to explore (e.g., the small car is also a rattle, the large fire truck's ladder moves, etc.) The cars are also very sturdy (as has been proven by my son repeatedly banging them together,) and they are easy for little hands to grab onto. At 6 months of age, my son really enjoys looking at the toys, passing them from one hand to the other, banging them together, and, of course, putting them in his mouth.

I'm not a parent trying to turn my children into geniuses, but definitely into maximizing their capabilities to incite their own curiosities.  Keeping children zoned out is not a priority--so for those who want to do that--turn on the tv and buy toys with bells and whistles.  For others, get toys like this one.\",\n",
              " \"We found this at a garage sale and I read about it and it seemed really interesting so I bought it. This is for the first few months of a baby's life and should not move much, contrary to what the first poster said, because you want stimulation but you don't want to over-stimulate a baby. However, we did notice that sometiems our baby does like the mobile to move and it is summer here but the air conditioner blowing air around the room should be enough movement. When it's not moving, we can just put a small fan on its lowest setting about 6 feet from the crib and the small wiggling was enough movement to keep her stimulated but not so much movement that she can't keep track of the object (babies this young are not good at tracking so you don't want a lot of motion), but still we only do this once in a while, not at all times.One of the best things about this mobile is that our baby only wakes us up at night to feed. If she wakes herself up she will sit and stare at it for a long time and be happy since we have a small nightlight in the room. Any time we put her in the crib we can see her staring at the simple shapes. Shown in the picture on the product page is the detailed shapes, you flip the cardboard from the simple to the detailed shapes when they are about 2 months old, then remove this mobile for a more 'traditional' one with movement and objects the baby can grab at about 4 months. This is a somewhat delicate mobile since it uses air currents to move, so you need to keep it safe from a grabbing/eating baby.Also, one nice feature is that ours came with a travel pack, or at least that's how I'm using it. Besides the crib mount, there is an 8 inch circular plastic ring with fishing wire for hanging the mobile. You can hang it anywhere with a string, either taping string to the ceiling or tying it to any overhang. It also came with a cardboard carrying case thing which is very thin and easy to take with you on a trip.For those with a math/science background, it's really interesting to note that first side of the cards have objects with very low spatial frequency. The 'detailed' sides are actually the same patterns, but with a moderately higher spatial frequency. After 4 months, you use standard mobiles, which have very high spatial frequencies, as well as colors and things the baby can grab to improve hand-eye coordination. Basically, you start showing the child very low frequency objects that are easy to observe and track, then gradually move up until they can use the high frequency information.Now, I want to explain why I did not give this item 5 stars even though it's an amazing product. Before my baby was a month old, I noticed that she was already able to detect some colors and this stim-mobile is only black and white. This is from 1990, so I guess over the last 20 years they have refined the product so that the simple side has some red (first color a baby sees) and other simple colors, while the reverse side has more vivid colors, but uses the same idea of going from low spatial frequencies to higher spatial frequencies. I ordered the newest version but still kept this around for changing table and pack n play entertainment since she loves it. If I had not known about the improved version, I would have given it 5 stars, but there is something better available so I highly recommend getting the updated version for every newborn.\",\n",

He has learned over time a bit better about how hard to bite down to make it go too and that it will go by chewing on any of the three available &#34;tips&#34; to the star.He also really likes the little spinning rattle on the end and it has little nibs that he likes to chomp on too (even though it is hard plastic and the star is rubber like).

If not, why wouldn\\'t the company simply label the product as BPA, lead, and phthalate free?Eight years ago, when I gave this toy to my sons, no one had ever heard of BPA.  My boys put all manner of plastic toys in their mouths, and I\\'m sure it was all riddled with BPA.

So as the kids aged, and wanted to walk on their own I could just toss this carrier in the diaper bag for when they got tired. Also with the kid riding either in front or on your hip, they are very accessible, so that you can hand them something, like a bottle or a bit of food when you are on the go.

              " \"I am the the mother of a 14 week old who has reflux and is uncomfortable sleeping in a crib or anywhere flat. She wants to be held *all* the time, and it was getting pretty exhausting in our arms (and my chronic tendonitis was flaring up) until we ordered the sling after reading about it in Dr. Sears's The Baby Book.  I had my doubts, but boy has it been a lifesaver!The sling has been invaluable for me, my husband, and our regular sitter. With it, we are able to walk, bounce, give the calming pinky finger treatment, and see what's going on with the baby. She started using the sling at 2 weeks, when she was about 7 pounds. It took a few times, but she is now completely comfortable in it and it is a favorite napping spot.As I am large-breasted, I did find it awkward to breastfeed in it, although I've been able to do it successfully a couple of times in public sitting down.  The fabric is soft and easily washable (important for those baby mishaps).  The padding helps me feel comfortable as a bit of protection in case of bumping.  The size is very adjustable for different height people, although you may need to pull through a lot of fabric to bring small babies in tightly, especially if you have a smaller chest size.The NoJo sling would benefit from having some loose fabric at the end to cover the baby's head in the sun and provide more coverage during breastfeeding. The stopper piece of plastic at the end of the fabric adds safety (it won't pull through), however it can whack the baby if you aren't careful when getting it on or off.  It could also use a zippered storage area, a feature of some other slings.  Also, the blue with plaid seems to be the only fabric sold these days, although I have seen other patterns and colors on eBay.  This is fine with jeans, but not great when you have to go to a wedding, as I did with the sling earlier this summer. I think it also makes people think that she's a boy, for some reason.  Maybe it's the blue and the fact that they can't see her cute dresses!The sling is also helpful in keeping interested strangers at a slight distance away from the baby -- they are less able to grab at her, which I think is good from a germ perspective, especially for newborns. When it is very hot or humid out, this sling can be a bit heavy for the baby (especially up against a hot mama!), but on cooler days the fabric adds just the right amount of warmth, like a light blanket.When I was pregnant, I assumed the Baby Bjorn would be all we would need. Instead it hangs on a hook most of the time unless we're going for a long walk or shopping -- activities where having two hands is important and you'll be doing them for a while. That thing is so hard to get on and off! Plus, you aren't supposed to use it until they are 8 lbs. The baby seems to really like the flexibility of positioning with the sling -- especially curling up happily in a womb-like ball -- and sometimes gets irritated by being all dangled out in the Bjorn.Carrying the baby in the sling makes you so much more mobile than using a stroller or lugging her around in her heavy carseat, so I use it whenever I anticipate being in public where they are stairs, space issues, or other impediments.  It's good for short shopping trips as well, especially if you're with a friend who can carry things or push a cart, both of which are harder to do with the sling on.She's also a million times more comfortable in the sling than in her car seat, where she often cries.  Our NoJo Babysling has been in constant use since it arrived, and ties the bouncy seat (where she mostly sleeps by day) as the best return on investment of any of the baby gizmos we bought.  Our sitter will often wear the baby for her entire nap. The sitter just sits (often in a rocking chair or porch swing to provide some more movement) and reads while the baby sleeps.One last thing that's great is that when the baby falls asleep, she can be laid down on the bed or bouncy chair and the sling just slips off the wearer without waking the baby.I did not watch the video, but did read the sling chapter in the Baby Book, which was helpful. We have recently started using the kangaroo (facing out) position as the baby loves looking at the outside world now. It's nice to have this sort of flexibility.  If you are getting tired carrying around your baby, and would like an extra hand free, a sling is a great investment and while not the most elegant, the NoJo is a good workhorse one to use on a daily basis.\",\n",
              " 'I love Dr. Sear\\'s books, but this baby sling is much too large!  I am a slightly small framed 5\\'5\" woman.  My 6\\'5\" husband wears this sling just fine.  But, for a sling to work for YOU, it MUST FIT properly!  I finally bought a sling that fit me when my son was over 1 year old.  I couldn\\'t believe what a difference it made and felt so sad that I hadn\\'t tried a different sling sooner. My son loves sitting in it on my hip and brings it to me whenever I am working in the kitchen. Try the Rosado sling or any other brand that comes in sizes and buy the size that fits your body!  You will really be able to enjoy the baby wearing experience that Dr. Sears recommends so highly!',\n",
              " \"We purchased the Babysling when our daughter was 2 weeks old.  I was looking for a baby carrier that I could wear while nursing her that would be comfortable and discreet.  Initially, I found the sling very awkward to use.  I wasn't able to master nursing her in the sling until she was 2-3 months old.  However, as a carrier the babysling was great from the beginning.  Our daughter was colicy, and being able to put her in the sling all cozied up to either myself or my husband, hands free, was a God send.  This calmed her 90% of the time.  As the months went by, being able to wear her in the sling enabled me to get housework done without baby crying to be picked up - she was already up, and was able to be &quot;involved&quot; in my daily activities this way.There are many different ways to wear your baby in the sling, and that versatility has made it one of the best baby product purchases we made.  Our daughter is now 2 1/2 (30+ lbs.), and when she's having a rough &quot;toddler day&quot; will still occasionally ask for the sling.Be patient with the sling.  Practice with it, and if you can, find a friend who has used one successfully.  Dr. Sears also has a whole chapter on using a sling (any sling, not just this brand) in his book The Baby Book - great photos in there to help get the hang of things.One last remark... I have a friend who tried this sling and was unable to get it tight around her body (she's very petite).  There are other brands of slings (Maya Wrap, Over the Shoulder Baby Holder) that come in multiple sizes that might allow for a more customized fit.\",\n",
              " \"This sling is the third baby carrier I purchased, when the first two highly-promoted products were too uncomfortable.  My son was a premature baby who needed to be carried a lot for the first few months.  After we purchased this sling, my son basically lived in it!  The variety of cozy positions were perfect for his needs, and the sling fits so comfortably on both my husband and me that we don't even feel the weight of the baby when he's in it.  In fact, the weight of the baby is so evenly distributed that you don't develop the shoulder strain or lower back sway that other products gave us.  We would recommend this sling to anyone with a newborn or premature baby, and we continue to use it now that our son is a big 6-month old baby.  Buy it!\",\n",
              " 'I got a regular carrier as a gift and I hated it! The baby would slide down in it, even though it says its for newborns. I have two other children and had to attend open house at two different schools. The first open house I had the baby in the carrier and it was awful. I ended up taking the baby out of it. My breastfeeding consultant told me about the sling an I went out and brought it right away. It is the best thing I could have ever got for myself and baby. The second open house was so much easier. The baby just bald up like in my womb and slept for the whole two hours. It was also great because I had both hands free to meet and greet the teachers. It comes in handy for breastfeeding discretly in public which for some moms is a must. The baby would sometimes get upset when taken out of the sling. I would recommend the sling to every mom every where!!!!!!',\n",
              " \"My neighbor had the Nojo and liked it so I was going to get one too. I tried hers, but I couldn't get it tight enough so my baby hung down too low which didn't seem safe and hurt my back. I thought I could order a different size, but found it only comes in one size. I then read all the reviews here and followed someone's advice and ordered a from babymoon slings. It fit me better (I'm petite) and was a lot easier to use (and prettier!). I think it makes a big difference to get a sling that's not bulky and comes in sizes - I don't get why they use so much padding in the nojo, it makes it really hard to use with a newborn compared to other slings.\",\n",
              " \"I have four children and have seen the benefits of the sling first-hand in varied situations.  My first was very small, and as a newborn, I thought he seemed lost in the sling so I exchanged it for a front-pack carrier.  Now I know that you can put a blanket or such in the sling to help cradle a newborn more securely.  It was a lost opportunity for us.  With the arrival of my second child, I decided to give it another try, as many of my friends raved about theirs and I'd need my hands free for my first child still.  I found the sling to be great for nursing, and afforded me privacy when I had to do so while out and about as I could pull the sling's fabric right over the baby and cover us both.  For a tired baby, it is much more conducive to sleeping than an upright carrier, and you can slip out of it and lay the baby down while still in the sling, if necessary.  My third child was (and still is) very cuddly, and enjoyed being next to me.  Since a mom's arms tire after a while, I found the sling a great way to incorporate baby into my routine without wearing myself out.  My fourth child turned our world upside-down with a very colicky start.  The &quot;insert-in-sling-and-go&quot; method was the only way to settle him down.  I could nurse, cook supper, do whatever I needed to do while keeping him close and moving, which was the key.  He learned to relax and even sleep while I was doing all sorts of things and making quite a racket at times.  Now at nearly three, he'll fall asleep while I'm driving and I can take him into the house, remove his coat and shoes, then carry him upstairs to bed without disturbing him.  I believe his learning to relax and sleep in the sling with so much going on around him has helped him in this area, too.  Most of all, it is just nice to have that close time with your little one in the sling, even if you are busy with other things to do.  I can't promise miracles, but this sling has been a crucial part of our early parenting and I recommend it highly!\",\n",
              " \"I bought this babysling after reading about it in Dr. Sears' book.  My daughter was 2 months old and fussy!  Nothing seemed to work.  I was desperate!  Since the babysling was adjustable I thought it would fit all body types...not!  I am of average height but on the slimmer side.  It gave me alot of shoulder and back pain.  I rate this a one star because I found one use for it...I use it tied around my torso to carry my daughter on my back with the slight support of my hands. Back carrying is a bit tricky so don't try it alone!  I think baby slings are great but not this one is not for me.  If you are slimmer than average, try the New Native baby carrier.  It's portable and comes in different sizes.\",\n",

It was quite easy. We bought this after having the others. But they spread our daughter legs too far and she wanted to lie down at times not sit up. It was great because she could sit or lie down. And when she was very fussy it was the only way to get her to sleep. We then just slipped it off and put her down. IT was Great! Now that she is older I no longer use it but it was such a life saver I could not bring myself to get rid of it.  I not only recomend this but Dr. Sears book to anyone who has a fussy baby.',\n",

There were no major smell problems until after one year, when our son started eating solids.  Also, we change the bag twice weekly as 3 days is about the max for smell-containment.  Around 20-22 months we started shopping for a container that would be less smelly and didn't find one as good.  (We have a cheaper one upstairs which broke immediately and always stunk!)  We finally just put the Diaper Champ in the attic a few months ago and use the cheap one with the flip-up lid - mainly since the cheapo fits inside the cabinet and we didn't notice a big difference in smell-control.  (The most helpful action is to tie the dirty diapers inside a small plastic bag before putting them in the pail.)A couple of our friends have this pail and were pleased until the children started eating solid food and things got stinkier - but that's pretty much the consensus according to many reviews on the different pails.  I've knocked off a star since the mechanism isn't that intuitive (to grandmothers and babysitters, at least) and it frequently gets stuck when the bag starts getting full.

The bag doesn\\'t seal around the dirty diapers, so when it comes time to refill the bag, it\\'s just like opening a regular trash can. Smells like the Champ is trying to knock YOU out with odor!2. The plastic seems to smell, ie. You put a dirty diaper in the hole, and flip the handle to dump the diaper into the champ. That \"side\" of the plastic dumper-thingie is in contact with the air inside the dirty diaper changer, so when you flip it over the next time to dispose of another diaper, you smell the last 8 diapers you put in there...pretty gross.3. The \"odor seal\" (some soft material) really seems to retain odor. It cannot be washed or replaced, so after a while, the Diaper \"Champ\" smells even when freshly washed and deodorized (I\\'m talking about hosing down outside and scrubbing with Clorox cleanser!). Super-frustrating!

They each had tried the Diaper Genie and had horrible results with eventual smells, and costliness of buying proprietary DG cartridges.  My family members eventually started bringing every dirty diaper out to the trash and leaving just wet diapers in the DG, that is until they found out about the Diaper Champ!Wow, what a difference, it seals in orders very well and using normal 8 - 13 gallon trash bags makes it economical.  The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.  Also, it needs to be away from the wall a little bit, so that it's flip top access lid locks into place and doesn't plop back down, but when engaged, the top will stay open so you can get at the bag of diapers within without having it fall onto your hand.We keep a little can of Oust nearby, spritz it before opening the top, grab the bag at it's neck to close off stinky odors, lift it out, twist it at the top and secure it with a twist-tie, and away we go to the garbage can.  And we take antibacterial wipes and run them around in the plunger area on both sides, voila, it's clean.At 3 months, we change the bag about 1 - 2 times a week.  Maybe as baby grows into larger diapers it will be more like 2 - 3 times a week.Still, that's better than taking every dirty diaper (8 or more a day) outside to the garbage can, especially in a Minnesota winter.\",\n",

This second step has kept the plastic from retaining a bad smell.I gave 4 stars because it\\'s not \"perfect\" -- sometimes a little smell leaks out if it\\'s very full.

The diaper genie is not odorless, but it does a much better job of keeping the room fresh smelling for a longer period before you have to empty it.  The champ is just like a regular trash can with a lid-just looks fancier.  I suppose you could use it as a regular trash can in your child\\'s room-they wouldn\\'t be able to get into it!

I decided to go with the Diaper Champ rather than the more popular Diaper Genie, because I didn't like the idea of having to buy special bags.  Too costly and not efficient if you ask me!THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFESAVER!! I HAVE NEVER HAD AN ODOR PROBLEM!No one has ever come to my house and noticed 'diaper odor.'  In fact, people who have been present while I changed my almost 3 month old son's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once I dispose of the diaper in the Diaper Champ.For those who are experiencing odor problems, here are some suggestions which should solve the problem:1. CHANGE BAGS FREQUENTLY!!  I change mine about 1 or 2 times a week.  For those who complain that the pail gets stuck, that is probably a good indication that the BAG IS GETTING TOO FULL!! Also, making sure that the tape on the diapers is secure will prevent that from happening as well.2. YOU STILL HAVE TO CLEAN THE THING!!  Hello, it does house dirty diapers!! All I do is wipe it down with some antibacterial wipes (takes about 10 seconds!!) and then maybe spray some Lysol in it and let it air out for a minute or two.  SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn't as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind:AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!) AND SO DOES THE SMELL OF THEIR DIAPERS!In talking with other parents, I get the same feedback - as babies get older and become toddlers, ALL DIAPER PAILS become gradually less and less effective until they are just no longer useful.  Again, this is because as their diet changes, so does the consistency and odor of their stool, in other words, it gets stinkier!!!All in all, this product is definitely one I would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price.\",\n",

But, by far the best thing about the Diaper Champ is that it takes regular trash bags so you don't have to worry if [the store] will have the refills.  It is definately a people pleaser!\",\n",

But once our daughter started to stand up, that big white handle was irresistable to her, and before we even realized it, she started flipping it. That makes the heavy center portion slide back and forth FAST, and sure enough she caught her finger and started yowling.This was *not* an isolated incident -- if you play with the pail a little bit, you\\'ll quickly see that the mechanism is a total finger trap for toddlers. Worse yet, they can slam a finger then hurt it seriously in their attempts to get it free by pushing the handle the wrong way. It\\'s really pretty scary.You\\'ll notice that the positive reviews here generally say \"I\\'ve been using this for two months, and it\\'s great!\" But once you have older babies, I\\'d retire it pronto.',\n",

When I had my 1st 11 years ago, I got a Diaper Genie and it worked okay, but the stupid refills for it were so expensive that I soon gave up on it.  Not to mention that the \"sausage links\" of diapers it created were pretty gross and I still had to use a garbage bag to dispose of them.  With this baby, I decided to give the Diaper Champ a try.  I LOVE IT!  In fact, I am considering buying one for my church\\'s nursery, after having to smell a pretty foul diaper from one of the other babies there.  I agree with any reviews that suggest using scented garbage bags, as it DOES smell pretty awful when you empty it, and I think the scented bags would help that a little.  So far I have had only a minor complaint, and that is that it can be a little tricky to open sometimes, but overall it\\'s still a great product.  I would definitely buy this again and recommend to a friend.',\n",
              " \"Our daughter is 13 months old and we've been using the Diaper Champ ever since she was born. I highly recommend it because it's a great value.  However, there are a few things to be aware of which is why I only gave 4 stars.1. Make sure the grip part of the diaper is not loose when placed in the DC. My husband learned the hard way that the grips get stuck on the seal and the diaper won't drop into the bag.  Then you have to pull the diaper out and the grips slowly pull away the seal.  It didn't seem to affect the odor control, but it did make it difficult to move the handle/shoot back and forth.  The company does send free replacement seals and instructions if you call and ask.2. The unit is top heavy when it's empty. I learned this one the hard way.  When pulling out a full bag of diapers be sure to put your foot on the base to keep it from banging you in the shin as it falls backward.  Ouch!!3. No, the stink isn't completely trapped, but it's pretty darn close! The stinkiest part is emptying a full bag.  I found that putting a stick-up inside the lid has made it much more tolerable.\",\n",

It is a complete life saver all around.  No special bags to buy, not a hassle to put together.  Comes almost all the way assembled out of box just attach to base & voila you are ready to start changing diapers.  A little tip to keep the odor down.  I wipe it out with antibacterial wipes a couple of times a wk, & I spray Lysol disinfecting spray.  Once a month I wash it out with a mild dishwashing detergent.  Also, to give it a little good smell I buy a 2 pk of stick-ups(.97 cents at Wal-Mart) & stick one in the bottom of the pail.You will not go wrong betting on this one.  It is a sure winner.  You'll save a lot of money by using this one.\",\n",

Using regular kitchen bags and holding more diapers than the competing diaper disposal system makes this quite efficient.A trick that was passed down to me from an experienced mom to control odor (again, yes, it's going to smell a little...you put stinky diapers in it!):  Place a Bounce dryer sheet in the bottom of the pail (before putting the trash bag in)and spray thoroughly with Lysol after each use.  I don't know why the dryer sheet works...but it does!  And if I don't change it out regularly (about once every few weeks) then I start to notice the smell.Recommended above all other diaper pails!  Price-wise the Diaper Champ just can't be beat.\",\n",
              " \"We originally had the diaper genie which we found to be a pain after the top broke off twice and all those replacement specialty bags we had to buy were getting expensive but not controlling the odors.  All that sausage shaped smelly garbage eeeewwww had to be put in another garbage bag just to get it out of the house!  My sis-in law had the diaper champ & I couldn't believe she even had any dirty diapers around...there was no smell!  We chucked the genie and bought the champ. It was so much easier to use...just roll the diaper into a little ball and drop into the hole on top, flip the handle and bye bye smelly diaper (my 16 month old can do it) And there were no special bags to buy, just the same regular garbage bags we used already in the kitchen. Experienced parents will understand and appreciate that it comes apart for easier cleaning for those times when it may become a mess.  We had a problem with odors after about a year of use so I called BabyTrend to see what they recommended.  They sent me these replacement sponge gaskets (free of charge) and we were once again odor free. Now on my 3rd child and almost 3 years later, I just called them again to get another set of replacement gaskets (again free of charge) they will be here in about a week.  THIS IS A GREAT ITEM and the company stands behind their product (even years later!)\",\n",

The Diaper Champ uses 10 or 13 gallon trash bags (or you can recycle larger store bags to use in the Champ).  The mechanism doesn't let odors out and if you have toddlers that get into everything, they can't get into the Diaper Champ!  Opening the Diaper Champ is easy but could be an initial challenge for some but once you figure it out it's simple to open.  I highly recommend the Diaper Champ.\",\n",

(The Genie requires use of their own bags.)  The plastic bags that work best are the larger kinds like the ones you get from Toys R Us or Ikea.  The plastic supermarket bags are a little too small.In regards to odor control, the DC has been successful for 3/4 of the year.  There is a noticeable smell during the summertime, so I've had to change the bags more frequently on hot days or else face the consequence of suffering the aroma of baking poop.My only negative comment about this product is concerning the lid.  For those who take great pride in your manicured nails, ask someone else to open it for you.  Even though I have short, uncared for nails, I've had a few bent nails from trying to pull open the lid.  Then, the next problem is that the lid doesn't open all the way (like a cigarette lighter).  It opens up to about a 75 degree angle.  This makes it inconvenient when you are trying to remove a stuffed bag of diapers.  Also, the underside of the lid has several plastic sharp juttings against which my hands would occasionally get scratched.  And, during the removal of the full bag, this is when you get the full blast of your little one's excretions (quite possibly 3-5 days worth of them), so hold your breath!Although there is room for improvement on this design, I haven't seen or heard of any other model that can do this job nearly as well for as reasonable a price.\",\n",

There's a little plastic tab that's suppused to slide in as your opening the top, but instead it get's cought so it allows the top to open up only partially. It may just be one defective item that somehow passed the quality control inspection, but I've given up on diaper pails in general.  Talking to 1st time parents, I found out that almost everyone gets one, but almost everyone stops using them very quickly.\",\n",

Not only did it do a comparable job at keeping odors inside, it was extremely easy to use and did not require me to spend an additional [$$$] each month on refills.  We decided to go ahead and buy a Diaper Champ because our son was only 13 months old and we figured he'd be in diapers for at least another year so we'd be saving money after 6 months by not having to buy the refill cartridges.  Then when our twins were born, we were so glad that we had the Champ!  After all, we're already buying tons of diapers, who needs to spend another [$$$] a month on those Genie cartridges?!As for ease of use, my 3.5-year-old son loves throwing the dirty diapers away for me because all you have to do is drop it into the chamber and flip the lid.  It is super easy to empty it too.  And I've found that if I use scented garbage bags and give the inside a quick spray with Lysol each time I empty it, the smell when emptying it is not as bad as it is with the Genie.I HIGHLY recommend the Diaper Champ!

Yes, if you don't wrap up the poopy wipies in the dirty diaper, you will have to clean poop from the chute (just wrap it up).  Yes, poop does smell (not like roses), but my daughter's room doesn't smell like poop because the Diaper Champ does a great job of containing odor.

Wipes get caught in the mechanism and you have to shake and bang it while trying to keep wriggling baby on the changing table. Poop gets into the chamber, and smears on the outside of the rotating drum, particularly when they get too full, which they do often. They're bigger than diaper genies, yes, but not quite big enough for a baby with a big appetite.This smearing problem, is, in my opinion, probably the source of the smell that others complain of. We have cured the smell by keeping handy a container of bleach-wipes, and frequently wiping thoroughly in and out of the drum. What a hassle!Our recommendation: buy a tall trash barrel with a foot lever, and if your toddler gets curious attach an appliance latch. You'd need to open the latch before starting the change, and close it after, but that seems easier to me than thumping and wiggling a diaper champ in the middle of the change.

The only time you ever smell anything is when you open the lid to empty it and all the dirty diapers are right there.  You never smell anything when it's closed.

I also love that you don't have to buy specialty bags for this pail.The only caution I give is to moms with long natural or fake nails...the opening latch doesn't release very smoothly. When releasing the latch (which is, wonderfully, a one-handed job, although it can be a tad bit difficult to squeeze), it springs open rather sharply. I have short nails but I can imagine long nails might get broken or fake ones snapped off if care isn't taken when opening the top.Also, the diaper disposal mechanism, which is great (!!!) since it really keeps the odor inside the pail, can be a little loud as it slides down into the pail, especially in the quiet hours in the middle of the night when you're trying to get baby back to sleep. Just be sure to dispose of your diaper(s) before putting baby down to sleep.I would recommend this product to everyone, even with these two very minor issues.\",\n",

I have twins--so you can imagine how much poop goes into this pail and I've never had a problem with smell (I've been using it for two+ months now).  You just put the diaper in the hole... flip the lid and the counterweight pushes the diaper down into the bag underneath and its ready for the next diaper--then you flip it back.  The flip handle does get stuck sometimes... but only when it's TIME TO EMPTY THE PAIL!!!!  Some reviewers seem to think the pail should empty itself, but unfortunately nothing on the market will do that for you.  When you change the bag (which is incredibly easy to do) you can just spray the inside with a little lysol and then periodically wipe it out with a sponge and some bleach.  I'd do that much even with the more expensive diaper pails and I'd still have to buy expensive special bags....

I would rather just walk each diaper outside!  So when we were pregnant with our son I told my husband that we had to go shopping for a new diaper pail and that's when we found the diaper champ.  I now give this at every baby shower I go to even if the mom-to-be has registered for the diaper genie!  I know she will convert to this one.  I have never had a problem with odor, and it is truely one hand operable, as well as taking less than a second to operate.  All you do is flip the handle over and you're done.  No need to push the diaper in with your hand (gross!) just let gravity do it's thing.  It is also very easy to unload and install a new bag.  Plus there are no special bags!

What a pain to have to remember to buy and then spend five bucks a pop on Genie bags.  Thanks, but no.All in all, I really like my Diaper Champ.  It's also taller than the genie which is good for me, I don't have to bend over so much to flip the lid.\",\n",

Another nice thing about it is you can put other items in it besides just diapers, and unlike the diaper genie you dont have to push down and smoush the diaper to get it in.  Wonderful item!!

The larger diapers fit a little better, but the monthly cost of special Diaper Genie bags started adding up.With the birth of our second child, I refused to use the Diaper Genie. SO in a search for something better than a smelly garbage can in our baby's room, we found the Diaper Champ.The Diaper Champ out performed the Diaper Genie, not once was the diaper too large to fit in the top of the unit and it was cost effective because it uses your standard trash bags!On trash day, we would open the top pull out the old bag, tie it up, throw in a new one, and out to the corner for trash pickup.Ten years and 3 more kids later, this diaper pail is still the Champ in our house!\",\n",

One thing you might want to be careful of, however...make sure you do not throw loose baby wipes into the Diaper Champ or else the flip mechanism can become jammed and after time will not seal properly due to having to pull out wipes that are stuck.

Besides myself, my husband and mother found the Diaper Genie very frustrating to use, changing the bags required quite a bit of time and energy, all the while smelling the stinky diaper smell. The Diaper Champ is not perfect, it sometimes feels as if it has filled up too quickly (i.e. maybe it's not big enough), and when you change bags you do get a whiff of bad smell, but the smelly time is very short in comparison.

We always made sure the tape was tucked in, etc., but the foam liner just kept coming out.  Plus, sometimes when the diaper was really heavy and big, like in the morning when they're soaked, it wouldn't fit in the chamber and turn properly, so we'd have to jam it in there, gross!Otherwise, the champ worked well on odors and accepting diapers.

The Genie does a much better job of masking the odors, Yes, it is more cumbersome in terms of changing out the plastic....but that I can live with.  The reason I gave it two stars is the ease of use with the Champ is superior....but I simply CANT LIVE with the stinky smell of diapers!',\n",
              " \"We put a Diaper Genie on the shower list for the first baby. We used it for 2 years and it was OK but we were fed up with it and I took a chance on the Diaper Champ for #2. After 5 months, we couldn't be happier with Diaper Champ. Here's a short list of the main reasons I'd recommend this against diaper genie:5. Diaper Champ doesn't use expensive refills like the genie. We were going through 2-3 of those $5 refills a month with the genie. On the conservative side, say that was $120 a year in genie refills. With the Diaper Champ, I bought one big box of Glad Kitchen drawstring bags (150 bags) for $15 at the warehouse club. We change the bag 1-2x weekly. The 150 bags will probably last 1 1/2 -2 years, for $15. (The Champ box says you can use plastic grocery bags. Don't. They're way too small and don't hold enough diapers to make it worth the while.)4. The Champ holds a lot more than the genie. Less frequent emptying.3. The genie was a pain to empty and even more work to change refills. Emptying involves tying off the tiny little sausage tube bag, restarting the cut end of the refill. Pain. Changing the refill was just annoying. When the refill runs out, there's not enough bag to tie so you are stuck holding an open end of a dirty diaper bag. I don't need that. And at any change or refill, you have to find another bag to drop the sausage string of dirty diapers into. With the champ, I open the lid, tie off the drawstring bag and that bag goes straight into the garbage can. The new bag goes in as simple as a trash-can liner and close the lid.2. The genie broke after about 15 months. There are 4 little plastic prongs inside that hold the diaper in place while you twist the ring to seal the diaper in the bag. The spring on one broke and it never held the diapers well again after that.1. And my top reason why the diaper champ is champ: It's perfectly easy to use, impossible to use wrong. Whenever we had a babysitter or family member helping while we used the genie, we always took a couple of minutes to show them how to use it. We'd come home and every time, they'd gotten in wrong and used the cutter tool on top and cut the diaper bag like they were changing it when they just needed to put the diaper in. No, it's not difficult to use or get right once you do it a few times but if you only use it once a month, that dial on top that turns the cutter is just to obvious to turn to ignore and impossible not to turn. Every single time someone got it wrong. So, the Diaper Champ. you drop the diaper in the open hole and flip the handle and it's gone. I can't think of a way anyone could do it wrong and most people who've used it so far, don't need even the simplest hint from us on how to use it.\",\n",

We were going to get a Diaper Genie like so many folks do, but the associate showed us the Diaper Champ and how easy it was to use. All I have to do is turn the handle and the diaper goes down.  There's no twisting and no special liners to buy.  As far as smell goes, ALL diaper pails will smell if they're not changed often enough.  We don't have a problem with ours smelling as long as we change it every three to four days (which should be done no matter what product you buy).  When I got pregnant with my second child (they are only 18months apart) we bought a second Diaper Champ.  We also just purchased one for my brother-in-law and his wife for their new baby.

Cons: kind of bulky and heavy even when empty, difficult to open lid for changing. Hint: If using spray cleaning, don't spray water into the drop-in hole.

We change the bag once a week and when we change a diaper we make sure to roll it up tightly and use the sticky tabs to close it up.\",\n",
              " 'I bought this after being gievn a diaper genie as a gift. This is much easier to use. You can use any type of trash bag with this versus the diaper genie where you have to purchase their expensive bags. I highly recommend the diaper champ for storing stinky diapers.',\n",

We change the trash bag daily but you could get away with two days.\",\n",

No smells, change it out once a week, easy to clean. Then a diaper snagged this foam material in the head part, so I pulled the rest of the foam out. Big mistake!!! Now it can no loner retain the stinkiness and we're looking for a replacement. Be careful of overloading and never take out that foam piece that is cushioned between pieces. I have figured out that it is key to keeping the stink out.\",\n",

Nice that you can use regular trash bags from any store.  So far, keeps odor out except when changing the bag.JUST ONE BAD THING...The only reason why we gave it only 4 stars is because sometimes wipes and even the velcro diaper tabs get caught in the space on the sides when flipping the handle to dump the diaper in the canister.  If you look at the picture you might understand.  After you flip the handle, the diaper on the inside goes into the bag when the cylinder you place it in is vertical, or completely upside down.  On the sides, there are walls that are snug to the round part that flips around. It is between the round diaper flipper thing and the walls that stuff could potentially get caught.  It is hard to get stuff out of this space.We've only noticed something in this space once or twice. We still recommend this product.\",\n",
              " \"We've had the Diaper Champ for 18 months, and it worked great, no smells, very easy to use, until recently.  Somehow (probably it got overloaded) the adhesive from a diaper snagged the foam that insulates the head of the champ and pulled just the teeniest tiniest corner out.  Once some poop got on that mesh/foam insulation, it soaked through, and now there is NO hope for the Diaper Champ.  We're going to get another, but just BEWARE -- these can fail.  Check you Champ carefully to make sure that no mesh or foam are visible.\",\n",

Every time you have to buy refills, it is almost as expensive as buying a new diaper pail.  Let's face it, babies are expensive and whenever you can save $ you should!!!I buy a box of bags at Target that I use for the kitchen and the Diaper Champ and they cost less than ten dollars for over 100 bags.My only complaint is that it is hard to get the pail open at first to change the bags, but it gets easier over time as it loosens up and you get the hang of it!If I had it to do over again, I would still buy the Diaper Champ!

I also use the Glad \"Odor-Control\" bags (the price of 100 bags is probably about the same as a DG RF and will last over a year).  The Diaper Champ is also very easy to use and easy to change bags.

She left it up to me and after reviewing both items I went with the Diaper Champ . . .  The idea of having to continually purchase bags for the Diaper Genie seemed like a waste when the Diaper Champ lets you use any type of bag . . .  My nephew is now over two years old and while he has begun potty training, my sister still uses the Diaper Champ I gave her . . .When it came time for me to choose a diaper disposal system, I put the Diaper Champ on my registry.  Yes, it can be a bit tricky to open (I found using two hands works best) but then again do I want something that is holding wet and otherwise dirty diapers to open easily?  True, the mechanism sometimes won\\'t \"swing\" the dirty diaper into the pail but HELLO that is a sign that it is probably time to put in a new bag.  Yes, it can eventually start to smell if you don\\'t change it regularly . . . but then again if you used a metal safe lined with carbon to hold your kids diapers eventually baby poop and pee smell would emanate from it if you didn\\'t clean it out regularly . . . Realistically the thing holds dirty stinky diapers and yep it is going to smell when you open it but hey . . . my kids tush smells when I wipe it but I still love him :)My personal tip . . . if you belong to a wholesale club like BJ\\'s, Costco or Sam\\'s check to see if they have the Glad Kitchen Bags.  The BJ\\'s we shop in has a box of 200 for $9.99.  As long as you do not attempt to overstuff them (i.e., get lazy and don\\'t change the bag regularly) they work perfectly.  I also use them in the small garbage pails in our apartment.  I could wait for a sale and use a coupon (the way I shop for most things) but it takes months to go through the box and I like knowing they are always on hand . . . At about $.05 a bag, the super duper box of bags makes my life easy and that as any parent knows is ***PRICELESS***.',\n",

There is generally more than enough room left in the trash bag, so in order to avoid changing a bag that is only a third of the way full, I have to open the lid and adjust the pile of diapers or rock the pail back and forth so the diapers fall and I can continue filling.3.  A diaper got jammed in it once when the sticky tab stuck to the foam seal in the plunger.  The only way I was able to dislodge it was to tear out the seal.  The pail still works fine, but now the plunger is loose so it bangs around when you turn the handle, which makes more noise than before.4.

Because it doesn't keep odor in as well, you really still need to change the bag often.  This from a mom with a breastfed baby, and supposedly breastmilk diapers have less odor.  In addition, it is a little tricky to open and close the bin.  The blue insert that holds the bag in can be difficult to manipulate.  No big deal.  I am still glad we chose this over the Genie, all things considered.\",\n",

I could not be happier with the Champ!  It is truly the easiet thing in the world to use--one hand is all you need.  We have not noticed an odor problem at all.  Yes, it might briefly smell when you change out the pail but I can't imagine other systems aren't the same way.  I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone having a baby!

It IS very easy to use, there's no twisting or struggling with the special bags, but when your little one starts foods and their mess gets a little more stinky, this pail does nothing to contain the odor.Here's the problem...there's no seal on the lid.  Where the lid opens to get the bags in and out, it's plastic against plastic that's not even remotely air tight that constantly leaks the stench of the inside.  Also, the chamber where you place the diaper gives you a waft of diaper pail air each time you flip it.I'm realistic that it IS a diaper pail and is it going to smell, but this product could do a much better job.  I DO empty mine at least once a week, wipe it with disinfecting wipes, spray it with lysol and let it air out for at least one day before it goes back in her room.  The problem is, you just can't get to all the surfaces in the top of the pail.  I spend more time struggling with this thing, cleaning it, and airing it out than is realistic.Save your money on this one.  The cost of not having to buy the diaper genie bags is not worth smell in my little darling's nursery.\",\n",

I would think that the poopy diapers were fine in this diaper pail until the parents would come home and ask why it smelled so bad in their house! Finally, I had to start using the \"champ\" for wet diapers only and walk the poopy diapers out to the street garbage can. Although I\\'m sure that this is better than throwing the diapers in your house garbage, there has to be something with some better odor control!',\n",
              " \"We did alot of research on diaper pails before our first child was born.  We knew a few couples with the Diaper Genie, and one couple with the Diaper Champ.  The couple with the Diaper Champ has a baby that is 3 months older than our child.  This couple liked their Champ just fine, saying they noticed no odors.  We also read tons of reviews, mainly here on Amazon, of both products.  And from the reviews, it seemed there were many happy customers of both products.  So we decided, if they were about equal, we would go with the more convenient and cheaper solution, the Champ.Well, we were pretty happy for about 4 to 6 months.  We very much liked that we could use our regular trash bags.  And changing the Champ's bag is very easy.  But after our child was well into eating solids, at about 7 months, the smell became unbearable.  It really is true that babies' poops really start to stink much, much worse when they eat lots of solids.  So we went out and bought a Diaper Genie, and are now very happy with the Genie.  The Genie has 2 big advantages over the Champ, in regards to smell control.  1) Each diaper is contained in its own litte pouch via the Genie's twisting mechanism.  2)  The filler bags progress in thickness, so as your child gets older, and her poops get smellier, you can get thicker, better bags.After using the Genie for about a month now, we are very pleased.  The Champ is essentially a simple waste pail with a fancy hood.  The hood and ordinary trash bags don't do much for odor prevention.  The drawbacks to the Genie though, are that you must buy their fillers, and the bag changing mechanism is much more complicated than the Champ's.  We thought these were worth dealing with to prevent the odors.\",\n",

We had used the diaper genie while working in the church nursery and found it to be extremely difficult to use with the number of diapers we were changing there.  Now our own baby is four months old, and we have loved having the diaper champ at home.  It is so easy to use and does not stink, or at least it hasn't yet.  We use Ruffies scented garbage bags and change the bag when full, about every five days.  I would definitely recommend the diaper champ.\",\n",

I did have some problems with the odor, but I think anything you put poop in and let sit for days will have odor so that's inevitable!  Here's some tricks for this Champ:1.  Put an Arm & Hammer Baking Soda box at the bottom of the pail to help eliminate orders.  And the obvious, change the bag every couple days to eliminate the smell... don't expect to leave it there for a week and have it smell like roses!2.  The side straps of the diaper will get caught in the shoot so make sure you roll the diaper really tight and use the straps to hold it together, otherwise your diaper shoot will get clogged.3.  If you're like me, you probably have tons of grocery bags laying around.  Keep a few handy in the nursery and use them to bag the poopy diapers.  Double bagging them helps to eliminate the orders.Hope this helps!\",\n",

My daughter is 19 months, still breast feeding and eating solids and let me tell you, her pooh stinks.  Once I decided to take the Diaper Champ out of the room and walk each diaper to the outside dumpster, it still took weeks for the smell to get out of the room.  It penetrated into the room.  Not to mention, one day, little tiny flies started growing inside.  I was changing the bag on an every day basis.  This is by far the worst product out there.

I just use the pastic ones from the grocery store.  They work perfectly.*It is so easy to use, so easy to change.  I tried another brand of diaper pail and you had to push a button and flip a lid and push the diaper through...no.  You should spend zero time disposing of diapers and all your time with your new baby.  The Diaper Champ is effortless.*It effectively keeps the room from smelling like dirty diapers.  I live where it is hot and humid and don\\'t have central air so smell containment is important.  It\\'s not perfect but if you regularly empty the pail it works well.  Scented bags makes the whole room smell kind of nice if you have a super-sensitive nose.*At first I was turned off by the look of the diaper pail, but I have come to appreciate its design.  I bought and tried out a different one and found that the Diaper Champ is taller (about 27\" high) and narrower.  This means that it takes up less floor space but still holds quite a few diapers (I empty it every 2-3 days).  Also I don\\'t have to bend down as much to use it, which really makes a difference when you use it 20 times a day.*A small but considerate detail--there is a foot around the bottom of the pail that you can hold down while you change the bag.  This along with the way the weight is centered in the design makes it so the whole thing doesn\\'t fall over when you open it to change the bag.  The other brand I had tried kept falling over when I tried to change the bag and it was incredibly frustrating.*The only thing against the product I would mention is the noise.  It makes a \"thunk\" when you dispose a diaper into the pail.  I don\\'t mind it during the day--it\\'s actually kind of fun to use.

Think of someone who comes to watch your baby - the diaper champ is so easy and they'll almost never have to change the bag for you.  That diaper genie was always full when I was babysitting.  Ugh!The only reason I gave this four instead of five stars, was because you can easily break your nails trying to open it up to replace the bag (the first time I did, despite the warnings!).  And the lid doesn't stay open for you to air it out unless you prop it open... but that's only for a few mintues anyways.

As an exclusively breast fed baby, there were no odors escaping at all.  (Formula fed babies have stinkier diapers, so I don't personally know if it would be as efficient for them.)  My older two actually enjoyed putting the diaper in.  It's easy to change out.  I always opened it up outside (if you try to open it inside there will be some odors escape), pulled out the full bag, sprayed the can with lysol, and kept a dryer sheet in the bottom which I changed every month or so.Now that little one is having solids, I personally don't expect any diaper pail to contain the smell, so I put dirty ones directly outside.  We still use it for the wet ones.  It has worked out fine because at this point he only has one messy diaper a day.I had a little trouble with the adhesive on the gasket thingee coming loose, but I emailed them and they very promptly sent me a new one for free, along with a few extras in case it happened again (which it hasn't), so I think the customer service is good.The only thing I don't like about it is that you have to empty it fairly often, but I also recognize that honestly that's ridiculous on my part.  The more it holds, the more room it takes up, the heavier it gets, etc.  And the fact that you can't go more than two or three days (as a newborn, anyway) is probably one of the reasons it contains the smell.  The longer they sit, the more rank they get.  Now that he's older and doesn't go through 15 diapers a day, I only change it about once a week.\",\n",

Woo-hoo!)  Also, you can use regular kitchen trash bags inside it, so you don\\'t have to buy special bags at an inflated price.  Further, due to it\\'s extra large containment area you don\\'t have to take out the trash as often as you would have to with the smaller Diaper Genie and the smell seems to stay inside just fine. :)The one minus that I experienced: According to the directions that came in the box, you can take apart the drum/piston assembly if you should wish to thoroughly clean the inside of it.  When we first bought the Diaper Genie I tried to take it apart.  I *could not* get it to come apart, nor could my husband.  It would not BUDGE-so much so that if the directions didn\\'t specifically mention that it could be separated I would have assumed that it was not built to come apart.

It's also super easy to use one-handed which is important with a squirmy infant either in your arms or on the changing table.  It took me a few minutes to learn how to change the bag, but that, too, is easy once you figure it out.  We haven't had a problem at all with the smell, but we do wipe it out with Clorox wipes every so often just to make sure.  This is one of those baby items I wouldn't want to do without.\",\n",

We don't have a problem with odors because we keep a roll of diaper disposer bags (little roll of blue plastic bags with a yellow duck dispenser) nearby in the changing table to put the smelly diapers in - this keeps everything clean and the blue bags are extremely economical to purchase (maybe $3 for 50 bags).  A small price to pay for an almost odorless diaper pail - we only use them for poopy diapers, not for wet-only diapers so they last for quite a while.  The bag in the Diaper Champ still gets changed 1 - 2 times per week because it's full, not because it's smelly.  This method also keeps the chamber and plunger free of messes.  Since the Diaper Champ can be used with any garbage bag, it's one less thing to have to remember when shopping and changing the bag is so simple and quick, it's easier than changing our kitchen garbage bag.

Everyone is right, you don't have to spend money on seperate bags, it's a nice height so you don't have to bend over it and it's really easy to use. I think it takes about a year though, or maybe even a little longer, and it will start to reek so bad that you'll want to sleep at the neighbors house just to escape the smell. For all of you who haven't used yours long enough-just wait, it will happen. We scrubbed ours with bleach, we emptied it daily, we aired it out in the backyard for two days, and then we finally started putting every single diaper in ziplock bags before putting them in the diaper champ (so much for no extra bags!). NOTHING helped. I'm not stupid, I understand that when it comes to diapers, nothing is smell proof. We emptied it all the time and disinfected it constantly. But I'm not talking normal stinky diaper smell. I'm talking the combined smell of every stinky diaper in the entire world. It was SO BAD. Unless you plan on potty training your child when he turns one, and good luck with that, you'll probably end up replacing yours before the diaper days are over. In the end we bought a Diaper Genie. We've used it for two years now and have had no problems. It kinda stinks a little when you open it, but the smell stays in there when it's closed.

I think a bit of odor is a fair trade-off for the ability to use normal trash bags and not be locked into yet another system of expendables. (See Braun shaver cleaning cartridges, etc.) The unit relies on a fairly tight seal between the bag (where it passes through the dark blue plastic holder) and the \"funnel\" bottom on the underside of the top portion. If the bag installation is somewhat off this would probably lead to a poor to non-existent seal.That said, the design of the unit is pretty clever - the piston and gravity work to deposit the diaper into the bag in one fell swoop as the handle is rotated through a 180-degree arc, without any hazardous poking of fingers in the vicinity of fresh poo.  That the lid latch is not immediately easy to pop open can be seen as a feature - keeping the contents safe from rude dogs who knock over trash for the goodies inside.

I have read the warnings about babies getting stuck under the sheet, and while I agree that this is very dangerous, I have never had a problem with mine.

It's protected our mattresses over the years.  I wouldn't use it as a top sheet since it seemed that the sheet could easily be bunched up or pulled off by a strong baby, and I'd be concerned about suffocation hazards if a baby wiggles their way underneath, or a choking hazard (if a baby pulls off one of the two end pieces, which go around the crib bars at either end of the crib, and which could fully snap off).

Shortly after she turned 4 she started waking up with dry pull ups.  We gave it a few weeks to make sure it wasn't a fluke & then invested in *two* of these pads.  The tuck in feature on both sides is great & I find that it does stay in place even after a nights sleep.  She finds it comfortable as she's never complained about it (of course, Princess sheets accomanied this new pad to encourage acceptance and we made a HUGE deal about her giving up Pull Ups & sleeping in regular underwear).  The best part about this design is that if there is an accident, you just whip it off (and any other top sheet that might have gotten wet) and tuck in a dry one.  No changing the fitted sheet in the middle of the night.  For us, if the top sheet or blanket gets wet, I've got a second comforter/blanket in her closet to quickly throw over her. (of course pajama changing can't be avoided) That helps get everyone back to sleep as fast as possible.  I've washed them a number of times & they come out of the dryer in the same shape every time (follow washing instructions). The size is also generous.  I was worried that she might move off the pad during the night, but with proper placement to where she normally sleeps most of the night, we've never had a problem.  It says it absorbs 6 cups; while we haven't tested that, I've never found the pad dripping, so all the urine was securely soaked in.  We haven't found a down side to these pads.  Even the price isn't bad-- I did some price comparison and maybe you'll find them a few bucks less, but not by much.  And, if I may add in a bit of my own potty training 2-cents, my husband wanted her to give up pull ups much earlier, but I was in no mood to change sheets (or these pads) *every* night.  I've read that most toddlers' bladders aren't large enough to make it thru the night anyway, so I was just as happy to let it happen naturally. In that way, everyone was happy (well I was and you know what they say about Mamma being happy-- everyone's happy!)  Thus, I highly recommend this pad to anyone going down the no-more-Pull-Ups Road.

I had a changing table given to me and this just fit right in it perfectly. I also got terry cloth changing pad covers with this gift and they fit nicely. Then I put one of those waterproof flannel pads down underneath the terry cloth cover and a smaller one on top of the cover where the baby's bottom goes. I wash the terry cloth cover once a week and don't need to do much more because if he pees or poops in the middle of a change I've got the waterproof pad on top as a back up and just change that out.As a newborn though, when I would put him on the changing table, his legs and arms would flail out and he felt like he was falling and he'd scream. At my mom's house she has a different changing table that has more of a dip to it where he lays and he never did that there-guess he feels more secure that way and can feel the sides of the pad and table hugging him. That would be the only downfall is that it needs to have more of a dip to it. Other than that, it's a great pad-nice and comfy and I like the cover that comes with it, but I've always got other layers on top so I never really see it.\",\n",

              " \"First off, these may not fit everyone's range. They are designed to fit a wide variety of standard-sized knobs, but may not work for you. Yes, you must remove your knobs to get these covers on initially, but if they fit, they definitely work. Yes, you must open the cover to turn your knob, but remember, these are safety devices, not convenience devices.That said, they worked on my GE Profile range, thankfully. From what I could tell, most of the GE ranges use the same knob types, so if you've got a GE, I believe these covers will fit.I had kept these (and a few other knob covers) on my wish list until my daughter learned how to reach up and turn on the gas. I had been reluctant to order because of all the snarky reviews - there didn't seem to be a highly-rated knob cover. Well, suddenly, I needed something right away! I immediately ordered these ones, which arrived very quickly (thank you Amazon Prime!), and I had them installed in about two minutes. Neither my wife nor I have any difficulty opening or closing these with one hand, and my toddler can no longer turn on the gas.On a negative, my knobs are located directly above the oven door opening, so I must agree with other reviews here that I run the risk of 1) snapping off the caps when I close the oven door, and 2) melting the covers if I leave the oven door open. I do not blame Safety First for this, if you want to consider this a design flaw - I would blame GE for that one! Knowing this has allowed me to preserve them from breaking (thanks to other reviews). I do wish that this was a 6 pack, though, since I have 6 knobs on the range - the main reason this is only a 4 star rating. I have a bottom warming drawer, which is electric and harder to turn on, so I opted to leave that knob exposed, preferring to protect the gas knobs, instead.On the positive, It works. My toddler was constantly turning on the gas, or changing the flame height on the stove while my wife or I were cooking - you know how they love to imitate. We would also occasionally smell gas, and we knew she had tried to do some cooking again. Those brief moments of the unattended wandering child are the biggest reason for these knob covers - scary to think of a gas explosion! :-( After installing these, she still reaches up to the knobs, but now she merely spins these covers, leaving the knobs untouched. And now that we no longer need to chide or punish her for turning knobs (really for just being curious), she has lost a great deal of interest in them altogether. These will stay on the range, however, until they break or are no longer needed.If they break, I will definitely replace with the same ones.\",\n",
              " 'We thought that these were the same Safety 1st knob covers that we had purchased two years ago. Those were larger, and were very easy to open with one hand, using minimal force. These are much smaller, barely cover our knobs, and are nearly impossible to open with one hand. One of us CANNOT open them without pulling the knob off of the stove, the other needs to stop cooking and concentrate on the proper amount of force to apply in order to open them.Overall, these knob covers are very good at covering knobs, and preventing little fingers from turning them, but they are not very good at letting you use the knob in a manner that will permit cooking.Take a little more time and look for the larger, easier to open Safety 1st knob covers (with a thumb-sized push-pad).',\n",

This product prevents her from unplugging my electronic devices, from trying to plug things into the power strip, and from flipping the power strip into the off position.  It keeps my child and my electronics safe!My only critique of this item is that it seems a bit flimsy when fully extended.  The power strip for my entertainment center is a pretty standard length and size and fits in this strip cover with the cover extended fully.  When extended, the cover can wiggle, and if wiggled enough, little hands could possibly figure out how to separate the two pieces, thus gaining access to the power strip.  In an effort to avoid this scenario, I have placed the product placed far enough under my entertainment center that my child would really have to reach to get to it, so the level of concentration that it would take her to both reach for the power strip and open the cover is beyond what she is capable of doing.I am still satsified with this product despite its weakness when fully extended, however, because when I placed the bare power strip in the exact same location, my daughter had no problem both reaching for the power strip and flicking it into the off position.  Furthermore, seeing all those cords, outlets, and plugs motivated her to move the power strip to where she could reach it better and within a matter of moments, she would happily turning it on and off, unplugging things, and trying to \"plug\" foreign objects into it.  So another thing this product succeeds in doing is making the power strip less attractive for her by covering up all the things she likes most about them- buttons, plug ins, and outlets.If this device were more readily accessible (ie: out in the open) I think my daughter would have no problem figuring out how to open it and thus rendering it useless.

I have only used this one for 1.5 weeks so far, but I find it to be quite efficient.  It's very basic, but serves its purpose.  My daughter seems to be comfortable with in it.  I either use the tray or push her up to the dinner table next to me.  I have not used it on the go yet so I can't speak on that aspect of it.  However, I think it's pretty much worth its price.\",\n",
              " \"This chair is terrific!  We go out to eat a lot, and my 7 month old is still too small for the restaurant high chairs or booster seats - she pretty much slides right out of them.  The three point harness keeps her in the chair, and the tray keeps her from leaning too far forward, as well as giving her a focal point.  Since she can't reach beyond the tray, anything that goes on the tray can go in her mouth.There are also two height adjustments and it folds well for easy carrying.  The only thing that keeps me from giving this a fifth star is how hard it is to put the tray on or take it off.\",\n",
              " \"My first son got this booster when he was 2 years old and we mostly used it when we traveled. But when my second son was born a year later, we got tired of having his big high chair in the kitchen. So when he was big enough, we strapped the booster to a chair and that was his place until a few months ago when he decided he wanted to sit in a regular chair (at almost 3).Unlike other reviewers, I have never had any problems with the tray--either keeping it on securely or getting it off easily (I think it is kind of funny that one product can have both of these problems!). The straps have always been adjustable to fit several sizes of kitchen chairs.I will admit it saves food well--to really get out a messy meal we take it outside and shake it upsided down then take the seat out. We did sort of solve the food under the chair issue by putting a dish towel on the seat of the kitchen chair before setting the booster on it. Then all you have to do is take the booster off and fold up the towel to clean the chair underneath!I loved this chair because it meant no highchair to climb over in the kitchen! And if we needed to go visiting we could just throw it in the trunk and have a highchair wherever we needed it.I'd buy it again in a minute. But someone won't have to where I live because I am Freecycling it to someone who can get even more use out of it.By the way, this one outlasted a different brand booster that my parents' bought for their house that was used half as much and was pretty much broken in two places when they pitched it earlier this year.\",\n",

My daughter is a climber.  I was afraid if she leaned over to far that the seat would flip.  We purchased a another one that fits much better.\",\n",

Because of this, at first I didn't think I would find much use for a booster seat.  Was I ever wrong.  I use it in the living room so my daughter can (have a dry) snack with me, play with play doh, draw, etc.  I just attach the back of the chair to the coffee table leg so that the chair is stable.  It is also much easier to bring along to functions as compared to a high chair. It also comes in handy when we are one high chair short, such as when we had a Passover dinner at my dad's house and my friends brought along their 2 year-old; instead of having them lug their high chair down there, I brought along the booster seat.\",\n",

The old Fisher Price one gave out a constant fussy hum and picked up far to much noise around the room (eg the wind blowing past our windows). I'm confused though about the packaging between this Graco Ultra Clear Monitor and with the 'Graco Clear Range Monitor' the only apparent difference being 'microchip technology' while both are using 'telephone technology'. However I guess the extra $10 is worth it because this is definately crystal clear, without hissing and without interference. It genuinely only picks up our babies sounds. It is not interfering with our 2.4Ghz cordless phone and I have no idea about the review which says 'it's too loud'. Turn the volume all the way up and only when you put a monitor to your ear can you hear hissing, which is why you only need the volume set down to 2 or 3 (out of 4). It has two channels and so far I've not even had need to try a different channel due to static or interference. Who needs 2.4Ghz monitors (for greater range) like the Sony one- unless you plan on mowing the grass outside while monitoring?

It also comes in handy when having company with a small child as one can use this and the other can use the high chair.  Folds up easily to travel.The tray is a bit tough to get on and off, but that is probably good so that the child can't pinch their fingers.I do have one complaint and that is regarding the strap. It is the kind that has one center piece and the two side straps snap into the center.  It holds the child in securely, but doesn't always come unsnapped on one side very easily.

The plastic is easy to wipe down, but we haven't had any big messes to clean from the crevices, so I can't complain about that yet. It feels very secure once attached and the only thing to watch is that the table won't tip from the unbalanced weight. Two things I wish were easier, first, depending on the table thickness, we sometimes have to put the chair part-way on and put our daughter in before securing it tightly to the table, so it really takes 2 of us to do it safely. She just can't maneuver into the seat otherwise. And second, it is a bit bulky even though it folds almost flat. It folds to about 12&quot;x24&quot; (I am guessing, don't quote that) but we just leave it in the cargo area of the SUV and it's not bad. Really is a hassle when carrying the baby, diaper bag, and this seat at the same time, so I use it only when I have someone to help me. Once in place, it has been a wonderful purchase!

Even laser eye surgery won\\'t help you see the diagrams clearly enough.  But after a bit of hunting I found a PDF of them online which you can ZOOM into and see everything MUCH clearer!  Go to the safety first website at safety1st.com and search for instructions for product number 71175.  Print, have a beer and read em through.Consider all surfaces before installation:The top frame of our sink cabinet had stuff in the way and the double doors don\\'t have a center post.  Doh.  But after a time-out and another beer, I realized I could  try attaching the strike plate to the inside bottom of the cabinet and it works just as well.  So before thinking it doesn\\'t work, ignore the diagrams and evaluate which edge will work best.From experience... avoid drilling 4 holes then re-drilling 4 more:SKIP the second part of Instruction #2 that says to mark the 4 holes for the lock first.  Just drill the center hole for the magnet plunger thingy  first.  I did as the instructions say and because I was a bit off on the center hole (remember the beer) all 4 of those holes were useless.  On subsequent installs, I would insert the lock (good time to test it too) and then once it\\'s all groovy, use the actual lock in position to mark and pre-drill the 4 holes to attach the lock to the cabinet.Save money:  use fewer Tot Loks on double doors:Before you buy 20 of these... One money saver idea...  if you have any cabinets that have \"double doors\" that meet in the middle, you can reduce your costs by just using a tot lok on one of them, then place an inexpensive sliding surface bolt or other interior cabinet latch (from any hardware store) on the inside of the second door.  Open one, reach over and pop the second one when you need that side open.  I did this on the lesser used, garbage disposal side of the sink cabinet and thus impressed the wife with my unusual frugality and common sense.Hope this is helpful!',\n",

Don't have to worry about smashed fingers with these locks.  Also don't have to worry about glue from adhesives ruining the front of your cabinets.  Once removed there is only a small hole on the inside of the door.  We don't lock our drawers since we do not keep any knives in the drawers, so I can't state how well they work on drawers.

I bought the 2 pack to try it and was so very careful because as some of the reviews said, you can drill right on through the cabinet and that is quite true, I almost did it on the first one I did. I blame my husband for distracting me, but I was holding the drill. Take it slow and BE CAREFUL! Consider turning the speed of your drill down so it doesn't get away on you. It's worth it, and as long as you use the little magnet extenders they give you, it will work awesome! As for being tricky, yes you have to read the directions. The first one took me about 30 minutes to figure out, but then it was easy! I ordered more and I just now put 2 more on, in about 10 minutes and they work super! If you need extra keys like we did, consider buy another couple of 2 packs, you pay $7.99 for an extra key and only get the key. For 3 bucks more you can get 2 more locks and the key and put them maybe in the kitchen where you have more cabinets.

I was not able to save this item to use with my next baby as the yellow lining inside the tub began to discolor but for the price this was an item that I did not mind throwing out after using it with only one baby.

We keep our little one warm by placing a wet, warm washcloth on her belly while we wash her hair (since this tub is in the sink and has the plug to pull - we leave the water running and can -re-warm her washcloth over and over) - a higher water level would be unsafe.

Leaks, pinches and mildew have never been a problem.  Oddly enough, we have found that our baby likes to sit in the tub backwards (once she could hold up her head).  This positon is more upright and also makes it easier to wash her hair.  We use the kitchen sprayer on low and place a washcloth over our baby's torso which we frequently re-wet with warm water to keep her from getting cold.  Our baby is still a bit small for 4 months, but we anticipate that this tub will work for several more months.  Our baby loves bath time!- Our baby is now 8 months old and about 16 pounds.

We gave up and put it in the basement (where it's collecting dust) and bought a new tub.This tub is a waste of money. Don't bother with this product, there are much better options out there.\",\n",
              " \"This tub was a big disappointment. It leaked the first time we used it. We ended up buying a simple one-piece tub. The two-piece design sounded like a good idea, but it was almost impossible to engage the locking tabs, and the gasket didn't hold up.\",\n",
              " \"We got this tub as a gift before our baby was born.  We had put it on our registry and were thrilled to receive it.  The sling worked great in the kitchen sink for the 1st 3 weeks and then we moved to using the sling inside the baby tub in our bathtub which worked great for about a month.  Now we have scrapped the tub altogether and Mommy takes a bath with baby.  Our daughter is long for her age and by the time she was 4 months old she was banging her legs, feet and knees on the baby tub.  We tried moving onto the sitting position with the safety bar in front of her, but it was impossible to clean all of her in this position.  We never had trouble with leaks however as some have complained.  Overall, skip this and go with an inexpensive newborn sling for the first few weeks/months according to your baby's size and then opt for a non-skid bottomed bath (one of those foam thingies that baby can sit on without skidding around-they cost around $6) for baby to recline in if you don't want to bathe with your baby.  We find that if Mommy bathes with her, she gets all of her crooks and crevices much cleaner and has a blast also.  In a month or so she'll be stable enough to sit without slipping and won't need Mommy's support.\",\n",
              " \"Terrible tub! We mistakenly used twice and it leaked both times...not from the center where it takes muscles to push it down to snap properly, but leaky on the sides...and then the suction cups stuck it to the counter and water went everywhere!!! I'm going to still try to return it ASAP!\",\n",
              " \"I liked the idea behind this product. It grows with the child which is neat. The sling is wonderful for newborns because you can use it in the tub or in the sink for really little ones. The only problem is that I don't really see how it will in fact grow with the child. My son is 3 months now and he's 24 inches. He's starting to fit awkwardly in the tub already. I guess it may work once he's old enough to sit up in the ring. The other problem I had with it is that it can't travel with you. It's way too bulky so you can only use it at home. It folds compactly at home but not enough to want to lug it around with you. Overall though, I really do like this tub. It's only $20 and you definitely get your money's worth.\",\n",
              " 'My daughter weighed only 4lbs when she was born, so this tub with the sling option saved me.  She was to tiny to be in the sink for a bath and this tub was just what I needed.  She enjoyed every bath in the 4-in-1 tub, the sling was perfect, then she graduated to the ring to help her sit still, and then the tub by itself she enjoys so very much. Once this tub was open and all the locks snapped in place we just lifted up the suction cups and placed it against the side of the tub to dry for her next bath.  No leaks, no problems, EVER!!',\n",

When open, it is too big to put in the sink and I don;t have much counter space. When carrying a full tub across the kitchen to the table, it leaks all over the floor. I have to pull the table over near the sink and use the sprayer to fill the tub. Terrible. Stick to the regular tubs that have been doing the job for years!',\n",

We used the sling over the sink in the bathroom for the first two months (we put one end on the countertop and the other in the sink so it was mostly flat).  This was great for me to bathe my baby since I had a c-section and no desire to bend over the side of the tub.  After that, we used the sling in the baby tub in a real bathtub.  Why use it outside of one?  It is really easy to fill, empty and rinse out when in a real tub, plus it gets your child used to being in the big bathtub.  We just set the sling in the bottom of the tub and didn't prop it up like the photos show.  No slidey baby that way.  My daughter used it until she was almost 13 months old.  I'd definitely buy it again.\",\n",

My second problem is that the sling is slippery.  My son just slides down. One time he slid so quickly that his back hit the grooves that the toddler ring snap into and it left a bruise on his back! I have to place a washcloth over the area to keep him from getting bruised again. I still use this tub because I refuse to spend any more money on an item that is only used for a few months but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else.\",\n",

Well, you have to take it off and wash it.  It does have that ability.  I used this tub until my daughter turned one.

While it has leaked a couple of times, the reason was that we put too much water in it--if you don't fill it too high, leakage is not a problem.  We have used it since our daughter was one week old, and the snap in sling feature made bathing so easy.  We keep it on the counter between our two bathroom sinks--it fits perfectly, and drains right into one of the sinks.  Our daughter is now a year old, but we still have the sling in it--it makes rinsing her off a snap.  We don't use the ring--it hasn't been necessary, she just sits up on the sling.  Now that she is trying to stand and twist and turn, I will probably move it into the bathtub, where I hope to get another year out of it. We do keep it open, and store it under the sink.  I agree that the snap feature is a bit difficult to use.  But I would buy it again.\",\n",

Secondly, when I filled the tub with water and picked it up, it leaked all over my floor.  I was so upset that I called Safety 1st.  They told me that the tub was not meant to be picked up and that the directions enclosed told me so.  I argued with them about this and demanded my money back.  It wasn't until that I demanded to speak to the manager that they told me they would refund my money only if I return the suction cups, the plug, and my receipt.  They said that they would send me a letter in the mail and after I receive the letter I needed to mail in the items.  It's been two weeks and I still haven't received this so-called letter.

But for a few month old baby the slope in the bath is great, she was able to lie there and kick and splash and enjoy herself.The only set back that this has is that because it can be stored (one side fits into the other side) smaller it has two separate levels,  the thing with this is that the slope goes over the deeper part and you have to fill the tub up with more water to get to the higher end.  Which means that you have to use that much more water inorder to get a good depth.  In my opinion this feature would be better if the slope was over the higher end of the tub.',\n",

When they were just infants up to 3 months old, I took the sling and put it in the sink.  After 3 months I put the sling into the bath, inside my bath, so I didn't have to worry about water spills.  When they were able to sit I took the sling out and adjusted the ring for them to sit.  When they were able to sit on their own I removed the ring.  As a bonus I was able to put my twins in there at the same time.  All the while I left the tub inside my big tub.  It helps to get them used to being in that area and to see the water come out of the faucet to fill up their tub.  The only thing I found was there was always a little water left in the tub after I drained it.  I would flip it over and leave it to dry.  I have no complaints about this tub what so ever.  My kids all loved it.\",\n",

However, once our baby was big enough to use it, she kept sliding down and it looked VERY uncomfortable.  I tried putting a towel under her and behind her back, but it was just very frustrating.  I then bought the tubside bath seat, but didn't like that either.  The seat sits well over an inch above the bottom of the tub, so you need to use quite a bit of water to get it up to her legs.  I know you aren't supposed to use a lot of water, by my little girl likes to kick her legs and splash.  So, I finally bought the 4 in 1 tub.  I wish I had gotten it from infancy.  It has a sling to use when the baby is really tiny, then when your baby can sit, the blue piece spins around so your baby is supported in a circle.  Our baby is almost 10 months and I am just about ready to turn the blue piece so she doesn't have it in front of her anymore.  Once she is too big for that, we can then move into the Euro bath and hopefully get a few years out of that.  Why use a ton of water when you can fill one of these tubs instead.

For my second child, I bought the First Years tub, which ended up being a total pain -- I threw it away and purchased this tub again.PROS -- I really like the sling for newborns. It can be used in this tub, as well as in your sink or large bathtub.  It's also easy to clean.-- The tummy rest is great once your child can sit up fairly well.  My babies both leaned their arms over the bar that goes across the middle and could enjoy splashing and playing with toys while I bathed them.  Having a good support like this makes it so much easier to keep a hold of them with one hand while grabbing shampoo, wash cloth, etc. with the other.-- It's great that the support can be removed for cleaning and for a last step tub before your child uses the big tub.CONS-- As other reviewers have said, it's a total pain to lock the center into place to keep it from leaking.  Once you've done it the first time, it's OK, but I was fooled and thought it had snapped (it was the side locks making that noise!) and it leaked all over my counter.  I don't understand why it's not just manufactured at the full size without this expansion thing -- it's not like it's that much smaller when it's not locked into place.-- The suction cups are very strong, and it can be difficult to empty the tub when it's on your counter.  You have to sort of pop up the back ones and then one of the front ones and scoot it over your sink.  It's a little tricky, but you get used to it.-- Because the suction cups are so strong, our first tub eventually got a hole in the bottom where cup pulled the entire plastic around it from the base of the tub (hence the need to throw it away after the first child).I have only one comparison, which is the one-star First Years tub, and I'd take this one over it any day.\",\n",

I had a hard time cleaning that part because a Q-tip didn't fit well.- You save just a little of storage space when the tub is folded.Now the details:Unlike other reviewers, I found it very useful for a newborn because my daughter fitted in the cloth and she seemed very comfy.At first I though the other reviewers didn't install the tub properly, because I didn't had any leaks.If I had wrote a review at that point, I would have given it 5 stars.But when my daughter was 6 months old, the leaks started.And when I put the ring in place: surprise!! The part in the bottom where the ring was snaped was very dirty. And I wash the tub immediatly after the bath, while my husband gets the baby dressed!I found this tub usefull the first 6 months, but now that we have the Eurobath, we know what a good tub means. It has to be durable, comfortable for baby, easy to clean and useful from birth to toodler.This tub doesn't meet those standards.Now we have the Eurobath, from Primmo. It is the best tub ever, even for a newborn.\",\n",
              " 'I love the bath station. It has made bath time a breeze!! It was a bit difficult to get the bath adjusted, to prevent the water leaking out, but after that it was smooth sailing. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with a baby.I cant wait to transition as the baby grows.',\n",
              " \"I went through 3 bathtubs before finding this wonderful tub. It features 4 bathing options,4 suction tabs, and a drain plug. Most infant baths I came accross are chair shaped. I found that my daughter could not get fully immersed in the water and splash in these chair-shaped baths. The 4-in-1 Bath Station By Safety 1st is shaped like an ordinary basin and has 2 options for how the baby sits in it. It is deep enough for my daughter to experience floating and kicking sensations which she absolutely loves. As a tiny infant, I would lay her on the soft slope and hold her so that her body was mostly covered. She would kick her legs and let them float. Of course, you cannot take you hands off the baby while she is lying like this, but that's not a bad thing in that it keeps you right there and vigilant!Now that she is nearly 7 months old she sits up in the ring at the one end. The ring goes accross her middle and between her legs. This was absolutely magical for her. I cannot emphasize how much she loved it; leaning forward and reaching for her plastic bath toys and kicking her legs and arms up and down. She also learnt to hold onto the rail in front of her for balance. While you should never leave the room when bathing a baby; with the rail in this bath, you can take your hands off the baby and watch happily as she plays for as long as you will let her. She cannot fall backward or forward, and nor can she get her head under water.The bath also folds up. The two halves slide together so that it is half the size. I don't often do this though I can see that it would be useful! However because of the join in the middle of the bath, the two sides are different depths. This is no problem - only, I wish the deeper side were the side where the older baby sits in the ring, and the shallower side were the side you would put the slope for newborns. Not a big deal, just a suggestion!There is one downside is that once the bath is full, you cannot move it. If you do try to slide it forward or backward, all the water leaks out of it! So once it is filled, best to leave it where it is!I highly recommend this product which you can use for many many months right from birth. The best part of it is that its fun and this summer I'm going to take it outside and use it as a splash pool that she can sit up by herself in!\",\n",

Our baby didn't really like bath time until he could sit up by himself, and at that point this bath tub became a necessity.  Baby loves to explore the tub, and the secure bath ring helps keep him safely and securely in one place.  He is now almost 20 mos and we still use it with the bath ring in place because he likes it better that way, too!  I especially like it because I don't have to worry about him slipping under the water accidentally if I look away for a second to get his towel ready or something.

Well listen up people, what a joke, it leaks out every time, since about use after 3 times or so, my Husband can't fix it, he messed with sliding it back and forth, locking it in, which is quite difficult. Pressing on the center area doesn't work either, it just runs like a siv! I was taking this back ASAP, when I found this site, cant believe the company is still selling these. Also for the record there are very few choices in tub brands for sale in any stores,they seem to be running the show here. If they could fix the leaky problem, I think this tub would be #1, but looks grim. I leave tub on floor in larger tub, I dont move it, as the cups grab rather strong and don't release too good.But it is comfortable for sitting for 9 month baby. No water No Bath, I fill 3 times when he is in due to water running out, to let him have some time to play. SAD in Michigan.....not many choices either.

Another reason why I think this tub is terrible is because once your baby can sit up, you can have them sit with the bar around and between her legs, once you take her out of that position her thighs rub against the bottom of the bar and leaves red scrap marks.

Once my husband read the instructions, we were fine.It grew with our daughter. We used the sling, to the holding bar, to the actual tub.

Also, I followed the directions exactly and made sure that everything was snapped into place (which is not an easy thing to do!) and the tub still leaked.  Not a huge amount, but who wants a tub that leaks?  I ended up purchasing the Summer Infant fold-up bath seat at Babies-R-Us which I highly recommend.
